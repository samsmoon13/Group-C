# Implicit Geometry Visualization

## Overview
This project is a .NET 9.0 console application that visualizes implicit geometries such as circles, rings, and more complex shapes by numerically evaluating grid points. The project uses object-oriented programming principles to represent geometries, enabling operations like unions, intersections, and differences for advanced modeling.

---

## Features
- Models geometric shapes using implicit definitions.
- Renders shapes as ASCII art in the console using a grid-based approach.
- Supports fine-grain visualization with adjustable resolution.
- Implements an extendable hierarchy for shapes, allowing custom geometry definitions.

## Technologies Used
- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **Language**: C#
- **Platform**: Console Application

---

## Task Description
The main task is to:
1. Implement a class hierarchy for implicit geometry as shown in the provided structure.
2. Use the `Visualize` method to create a grid-based numerical representation of the geometry.
3. Model complex shapes (e.g.circules,rectangles, combinations of basic shapes) using set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
4. Render these geometries in the console.

## Class Hierarchy
1. **ImplicitGeometry** (Abstract Class):
    - Base class for all geometric shapes.
    - Defines the `IsInside` method to determine if a point lies inside the shape.
    - Contains the `Visualize` method for grid-based visualization.

2. **Circle** (Derived Class):
    - Represents a circle defined by its radius and center point.
    - Implements the `IsInside` method to check whether a point lies within the circle.

3. **Rectangle** (Derived Class):
    - Represents a rectangle defined by its top-left and bottom-right corners.
    - Implements the `IsInside` method to check whether a point lies within the rectangleâ€™s bounds.

4. **Operation** (Abstract Class):
    - A base class for geometric operations such as `Union`, `Intersection`, and `Difference`.
    - Takes two `ImplicitGeometry` objects as operands and applies set operations.

5. **Union**, **Intersection**, and **Difference** (Derived Classes):
    - Perform set operations to combine or subtract geometries.
    - These operations allow for more complex geometric shapes like unions of multiple shapes or intersections.

## How to Run
1. **Requirements**:
   - .NET 9.0 SDK installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Run the following commands in your terminal:
   git clone <repository-url> cd ImplicitGeometryVisualization

3. **Build the Project**:
Run:
    dotnet build

4. **Run the Application**:
Run:
    dotnet run

## Example Usage
```csharp
var circle = new Circle(5, new Point(10, 10));
circle.Visualize(20, 20);

Width: 20
Height: 20

Output (Console Visualization of a Circle):
    ooo     
 ooooooo    
ooooooooo   
 ooooooo    
    ooo     
```

## Customization
1. **Modify grid dimensions (width and height) for different visualization sizes.**
3. **Extend the ImplicitGeometry class to add new shapes.**:
